### About me

    <!-- ACTIVITY GRAPH -->
    I'm a software developer based in Bergen, Norway. Currently working as a freelancer, taking  jobs from both individuals and businesses. 
    With a great passion for learning and honing my skills, I never say no to a challange. Apart from my development carreer I have background in finance from BI business school, and have years of experience as an artist which I think goes along well with UI design. <img width=665 height=200 align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Borgerod/Borgerod/main/profile-summary-card-output/github_dark/0-profile-details.svg"/> Software development for me is a playground for crativity and problem solving, which is an arena I thrive in. I live and breath coding, and most of my day is spent infront of the keyboard creating obsessvly. Honestly, I think coding is genuinly fun, and I could spend days typing away without even noticing. If anything, I have to force myself to do other things.
    In a nutshell I would describe myself as resilient, solution driven and not to mention stubborn. If i don't know how to solve something, I will find out, or I will bash my head into the problem until it's fixed. 
    <img height=200 width=300 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Borgerod/Borgerod/main/profile-summary-card-output/github_dark/1-repos-per-language.svg" align="left" />     In regards to my expereince, I've found that I'm quite good at data extraction, where I've had tons of practice, as you might can tell from my repo.
    Most of my experence comes from Python, then Dart, Postgres. But in the near future I plan to expand my knowledge and start leaning another language, such as Jave, Rust or Goland. My upcomming goals are; Cloud integration, automatization and dive further down into data science. 
    Don't hesitate to make contact if you have any questions or ideas for future projects, I'd love to hear them. <br>Take care and have fun creeping through my profile!
